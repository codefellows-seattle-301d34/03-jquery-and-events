# 03 jQuery and Events

**Author**: Karen Lai & Sam Porter Giffords
**Version**: 1.0.2

## Overview
* This application allows a reader of this blog to filter on both author and category names.  

* It also shortens long blog posts while allowing the reader to click for more content in each article. 

As a user, I want tab-based navigation so that I can easily visit other sections of my site.

Complete the method articleView.handleMainNav() for implementing tab-based event navigation on the page.

* Code is thoughtfully organized, easy to read, and executing efficiently.

* Added one script tag for articleView.js to HTML file.

* Refactored concatenation using template literals.

Render the app upon page load.

Stretch Goals

As a user, I want to be able to collapse an expanded article to the teaser view so that I can more easily scan over a series of articles.

Build in functionality such that a user can click on "Show Less" to collapse a full article into a teaser.

## Architecture
HTML was used for structure, CSS for styling, Javascript for functionality, and jQuery to automate some of the functional pieces.

## Change Log
Not really useful to us today
